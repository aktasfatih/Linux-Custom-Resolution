# Linux-Custom-Resolution
This is a script for setting a custom resolution in a linux environment. I use it to set my resolution to 1500 to 1000 on my Surface book. It is a script that pretty much runs the code in this [page](https://aktasfatih.com/linux-mint-setting-a-custom-resolution/)

If you are using a Surface-Book and have a problem with the resolution for Ubuntu, you can use this script.

## How-to-use
1. Edit the RESOLUTION variable in the file "fixResolution.sh".
2. For example, `RESOLUTION="1500 1000"` is going to set the resolution to be 1500 by 1000.
3. Run the bash code using `sh ./fixResolution.sh`

Enjoy,
Fatih
